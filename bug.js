This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The app becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive re-renders caused by inefficient key extraction or improper data updates.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>  }
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} //Potential problem here
/>
```

The `keyExtractor` function might be inefficient or incorrect, leading to unnecessary re-renders.  Incorrect data updates, even minor changes, can trigger full re-renders if not handled properly, especially with large lists.
